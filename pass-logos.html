<p class="text">The first piece of context that should be presented is that I am a major fan of soccer and, more directly linked with this piece, of my hometown soccer club the Los Angeles Galaxy. So when looking into what type of collage I would try my hand at creating I looked no further than trying to created something emulating sports passion and history for this team. The main influence for my collage came from marketing and advertising that is currently being used by the LA Galaxy for the start of the new 2019 season. In a way I wanted to mimic the current style while also harkening back to previous years of the team with the use of various team icons. I even asked for some feedback on an online forum from other fans and they sent their suggestions of icons significant to the club’s history and shared their support. <br>
For the style of the characters I rendered them at a low fidelity creating an almost posterized style based off previous works I had done and utilized the tracing tool in Illustrator in order to achieve this look. I created the border using the blend tool with the replace spine feature that we also learned in class, which made for a similar look to the one used in the official adverts. I brought these assets into Photoshop and utilized the layering system to create the overlays of each character and created a basic background with various colors and the use of the gaussian blur effect. I also used the slogan of the team that has emerged in recent years “Since 96” calling to the teams first year of official play in the league (Major League Soccer) with its importance also being that it was the league’s first year of existence. <br>

<p class="text">The AR overlay aspect of the piece also drew from the style of marketing that is used by the team. The style is very 90’s as it is meant to draw back to the time the team and league began. One major us is that of CRV televisions, which were prone to have some distortion and glitching as well as some RGB shifting which I was able to mimic using the tools in PhotoMosh.</p>
