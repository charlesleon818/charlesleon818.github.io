<h3>Rational</h3>
<p class="text">Like many people trying to find some sense of identity, I found it fitting to photograph something with one of my major interests besides photography. Soccer was not always part of my life, but ever since I’ve learned, played, and watched the sport it has been a key part of my life both as I grew up and continue to grow. Soccer was an entry point for me to a significant portion of people I consider some of my truest friends. While it may be hard to find a sense of national pride in our current political climate, international games have been a real source of cementing my national identity, though at times it has been difficult being of mexican descent yet being born in America. To keep things simple however, American soccer has been where I find a lot of pride thats why a number of photos feature soccer related objects and designs from the jerseys I wear representing my home town in L.A. to national identity of Mexican-American.<br>
Aside from soccer it’s very hard for me to determine who I truly am, I think that is why looking back now I didn’t show my face clearly in any of the photos. I usually rely on friends or family or outsiders to judge me based off of the slate I present and typically agree that I am that person they say I am. The silhouette evoke more in its positions than the facial expression and tell of a role I’ve played in my short life, but never truly connected with.<br>
There is a photo on my hand taking notes in class, this is because school has been a very large part of my life so far. I came to SJSU right out of Highschool. Back home in Highland Park were I grew up, the school was a big part of the community. Not only was it a part of me, it's were I developed as a young adult and came to hold the values I have today. Even now I connect to the work I am doing not only in this class but all my other classes.<br>
My glasses, looking back now, are really symbolic to me personally because of the time that I received them. It was around sophomore year in Highschool when I took my first photography class. The experience was one of clarity because I had found something that, not only I was passionate about but also possessed talent and potential in to really work towards and am hoping to make a career out of. Not only that but it was were I met with my first life mentor who happened to teach that class and was there for me through the rest of highschool.<br>
The image of me in the room is meant to showcase my movement in my own personal space. It is generally hard for me to stay put for long so moving in a space is a common thing I do. Especially if I am working on a project or assignment it helps to clear my head and develop ideas more effectively.</p><br>
